In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to utilize scDock with GSE149878 dataset from NCBI GEO website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149878). This scRNA dataset contains 4 lung tissue samples from a COVID-19 severe patient.  

● Data preparation:  
Please manually download those data to your computer and should get:  
`GSM4516279_C166_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5`  
`GSM4516280_C168_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5`  
`GSM4516281_C170_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5`  
`GSM4516282_C172_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5`  

● Modify config.yaml:  
Here are the demonstrate setting for config.yaml:  
`work_path: "/home/andrew/scDock"`
