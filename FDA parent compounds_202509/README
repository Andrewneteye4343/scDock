Here, we provide a list of compounds (FDA_202509_compounds.xlsx) from FDA Drug website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drugsfda-data-files) [version September 2nd, 2025] (accessed September 4th, 2025).
The .xslx were acquired by the "Get CAS from compound name.py". By giving the compound names from the above list, "Get CAS from compound name.py" output the PubChem CID and CAS number of the given compound name as well as their parent compound's name, PubChem CID, and CAS number.

In the .xslx, there are six columns, including Input Name, Input CID, Input CAS, Parent Name, Parent CID, and Parent CAS.
Due to the limitation of molecular docking, we can only use the major component of a drug, which is the parent compound. The parent compound CAS number are recorded in fda.txt.

If you want to use the FDA compound list as drug library, you need to:
1. Make sure to set "use_fda" argument as true and provide "fda_txt_path" argument in config.yaml$vina_docking.
2. Place the fda.txt we provide in this page at the correct directory (same as "fda_txt_path" that you provide).

By following the instuctions, scDock will automatically download and pre-process the corresponding FDA parent compounds for the further molecular docking.
